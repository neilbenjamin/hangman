too large to transfer actoss dropbox.

Install node.js, navigate to the project root directory of the game file on your machine and open your terminal and type in `npm install`.

#### Resources and Solutions    

I followed Jesse from CodekackR's example to guide me on  the layout and logic for the project and then adapted it to my liking. He followed Brad Traversy's vanilla JS example on gitHub and compiled it for React.

I also relied on WebDevSimplified to assist with refreshing the useEffect and State logic in react. 

OpenAI for assistance with some of the conditional syntactical challenges especially with the the ternary operators in react as well as the logic inside the useEffect hook, which was very tricky.

Bootstrap and local css for styling.
